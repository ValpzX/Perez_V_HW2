    <p>Creating Repositories - Authoring 1</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Assignment Description</h2>

    <p>You will be building a Github Repository for each of your homework assignments for Authoring 1. Use these repositories to complete the requirements for each assignment. After the initial submission, you DO NOT NEED TO RESUBMIT to FOL. Just update the main branch with pull requests, commits and merges.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Assignment Requirements</h2>

    <p>Create a repository on Github for each homework assignment (refer to the appropriate section in the course content for number of assignment repos you'll need).</p>
    <p>Add the required content to the Readme file, using the template provided as a reference.</p>
    <p>Make sure to implement these edits on a new branch - NEVER work directly on the main branch.</p>
    <p>Create the correct project structure - files and folders - for each assignment. Push the changes to your repo and merge those changes to the main branch. Submit your Github repo link to FOL.</p>
